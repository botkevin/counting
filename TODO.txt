1. Get selective search working with feature detection
    - first should get main program working without selective search, but i think we should do this anyways
    - selective search feed into program
    - selective search display
    - implement basic scoring method
    - Non Maximum Suppression (NMS)
    - fancy scoring method
    - deal with 0 keypoints. queryDescriptors.type() == trainDescCollection[0].type() error

2. Multi image
    - find a good way to plot geometric/spatial connections for SVM

Welp basic cutoff is terrible. Ratio test cannot correctly tell if the object exists or not.
    - doesnt even find the correct thing, too little matches
        - try to compare not using selective search with selective search matches
        - try matching screen to screen (same picture)
    - have to try with the new images
    - display knnmatches to see if we can identify a problem
    - it may be due to a bunch a features matching to a small square in the search patch
        - in this case it may be better to reject matches that match to the same area
