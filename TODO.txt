1. Get selective search working with feature detection
    - first should get main program working without selective search, but i think we should do this anyways
    - selective search feed into program
    - selective search display
    - implement basic scoring method
    - Non Maximum Suppression (NMS)
    - fancy scoring method
    - deal with 0 keypoints. queryDescriptors.type() == trainDescCollection[0].type() error

2. Multi image
    - find a good way to plot geometric/spatial connections for SVM
